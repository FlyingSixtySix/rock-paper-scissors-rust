# rock-paper-scissors-rust

## Motivation

I wanted to start my journey of learning Rust by making a simple Rock Paper Scissors game.

## Usage

```
./rock-paper-scissors-rust
```
When prompted for a selection, enter `r`/`rock`, `p`/`paper`, `s`/`scissors`, or `q`/`quit`.
Whether you win, lose, or tie, the game will loop the prompt until you quit.

## Building

```
cargo build --release
```
The output executable is in `target/release/`, titled `rock-paper-scissors-rust`. Extension depends on the operating system.
